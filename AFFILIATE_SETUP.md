4. Copy this ID (format: `1234567`)

## ‚õ≥ Golf Course Tee Time Links

### Current Implementation: Direct Course Links
The site currently uses **direct booking links** to each golf course's official website.

### Option A: Keep Direct Links (Current)
**Pros:**
- Higher conversion (golfers prefer official course sites)
- No middleman fees
- Can negotiate direct referral agreements with courses
- Better trust signal

**How to monetize:**
1. Contact courses directly (emails in course data)
2. Propose referral partnership: 5-10% commission per booking
3. Use unique tracking codes: `?ref=adarelimerickgolf`
4. Track conversions via course booking confirmations

**Recommended courses to contact first:**
- Adare Manor
- Ballybunion Golf Club
- Lahinch Golf Club
- Tralee Golf Club
- Trump International Doonbeg

### Option B: Add GolfNow/TeeOff Affiliate Program

**GolfNow Affiliate Program:**
- Sign up: https://www.golfnow.com/affiliates
- Commission: $5-15 per booking
- Cookie: 30 days
- **Issue**: Limited Irish course inventory

**TeeOff.com:**
- Similar to GolfNow
- Better for US courses, limited Ireland coverage

**To implement GolfNow:**
1. Sign up and get your affiliate ID
2. Update `/lib/affiliates.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const GOLFNOW_AFFILIATE_ID = 'your_id_here';
   ```
3. Uncomment GolfNow link generation in `generateGolfNowLink()`

     window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
     function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
     gtag('js', new Date());
     gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
   </script>
   ```

## üí∞ Expected Revenue (Ryder Cup 2027)

### Conservative Estimates:
**Assumptions:**
- 5,000 monthly visitors during Ryder Cup season (6 months before event)
- 2% click-through rate on hotel bookings
- 30% conversion rate (industry avg for Booking.com)
- ‚Ç¨25 avg commission per booking

**Calculation:**
- 5,000 visitors √ó 2% CTR = 100 clicks/month
- 100 clicks √ó 30% conversion = 30 bookings/month
- 30 bookings √ó ‚Ç¨25 commission = **‚Ç¨750/month**
- **‚Ç¨4,500 total (6 months)**

### Peak Month (September 2027):
- 20,000+ visitors expected
- Potential: **‚Ç¨3,000+ in September alone**

### Golf Course Commissions (if direct deals negotiated):
- Assume 500 tee time clicks/month
